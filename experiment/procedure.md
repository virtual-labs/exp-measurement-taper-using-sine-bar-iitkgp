**Steps to perform the simuation**

1. At first choose the test object position on Sinebar to either left or right side from the given dropdown button.

2. Add height(H) or slipgauge to make the hypotenuse side of the object parallel to the plane (brown plane).
Add the heights through the given ranger slider slowly. When it seems to be parallel with brown plane (when H &thickapprox; 63.5),
click on 'Calibrate' button. The dial gauge will show 0 deflection exactly.

3. Click on 'Table' at the bottom of the page to see the observation table and click on 'Add to Table' button to fill the observation table.

4. Click on 'Clear' button to erase the observation data. Click on 'Table' button to hide the observation table.
Change the position of the test object to other side of the Sinebar and measure the angle following the steps 2-4.
